4. Learn some basic tailoring skills If you want to save some money and time, you can learn some basic tailoring skills yourself. You don't need a lot of equipment or experience to do simple alterations like hemming, taking in seams, or adding darts. You can find many online tutorials and videos that teach you how to tailor your own clothes. You can also invest in a good sewing machine that has features like automatic buttonholes, blind hem stitch, and overlock stitch. A sewing machine like the Brother Innov-is F580 can help you achieve professional-looking results with ease.
 
5. Know when to go to a professional tailor While you can do some basic tailoring yourself, there are some situations where you need to go to a professional tailor. For example, if you need to alter the shoulders, collar, or lapels of a jacket, you should leave it to an expert. These areas are very tricky and require precise cutting and sewing. A professional tailor can also handle complex alterations like reshaping the silhouette of a garment, adding lining, or changing the style of a garment.
 
6. Choose the right fabrics for tailoring Not all fabrics are suitable for tailoring. Some fabrics are too delicate, stretchy, or slippery to work with. Others are too thick, stiff, or bulky to drape well. When choosing fabrics for tailoring, look for ones that have some structure and stability, but also some flexibility and movement. Some examples of good fabrics for tailoring are wool, cotton, linen, silk, and polyester blends. Avoid fabrics that are too sheer, shiny, textured, or patterned.
